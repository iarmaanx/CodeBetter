DNS (Domain Name System) is like the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-friendly domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.72.206) that computers use to locate each other on the network.

For example:When you enter www.example.com in your browser, DNS translates it to 93.184.216.34, allowing your browser to connect to the server where the website is hosted.

Here Route 53 is a DNS which is provided by Amazon Web Servies.
