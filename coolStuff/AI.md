# What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)

(AI) is the branch of computer science that creates machines or softwares capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. 

AI can be broadly categorized into **three types** based on their capabilities:

### 1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**
Designed to perform a specific task or a narrow range of tasks.
   - **Examples**: 
     - **Siri** or **Alexa** (voice assistants).
     - **Recommendation systems** (like those on Netflix or Amazon).
     - **Image recognition software** (used in apps like Google Photos).
   - **Capabilities**: Can outperform humans in specific tasks but doesn't possess general intelligence.

### 2. **General AI (Strong AI)**
Hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can do, with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in different contexts.
   - **Examples**: 
     - Currently, **no true examples** exist, as General AI is still a concept and under research.
   - **Capabilities**: Would have reasoning, problem-solving abilities, and consciousness similar to humans.

### 3. **Superintelligent AI**
AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects, including creativity, problem-solving, and social intelligence.
   - **Examples**: 
     - **Theoretical** and does not currently exist. Often depicted in science fiction.
   - **Capabilities**: Would be far superior to human intelligence, potentially capable of solving complex global challenges.
